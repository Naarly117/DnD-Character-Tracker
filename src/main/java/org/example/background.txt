Hairball
Shifter, Artificer, Outlander

-Grew up in a small town in the outlands
-Town was comprised entirely of gunslingers who wielded 
futuristic, almost supernaturally advanced weaponry
-The town of gunslingers kept to themselves and had little contact
with other societies. Outsiders knew little about the gunslingers,
but rumors of the gunslingers' advanced weaponry scared them
-Was raised as a gunslinger, and also discovered that he could use
magic, making him one of only a few magicians in their society
-Found that he has exceptional aim and offensive magical abilities
in combat, but when not focused on combat he is consistently clumsy
and accidentally discharges his guns frequently
-A mercenary leader heard tales of their advanced weaponry and
decided he wanted it for himself. Unbeknownst to the gunslingers 
due to their isolationist nature, he assembled a massive army, and
attacked the town in the middle of the night
-Despite their technological advantage, the gunslingers were
overwhelmed and the town was destroyed
-Thanks to his magical abilities Hairball managed to escape, 
but was forced to leave behind everything except for a 
small .22lr revolver
-He knows how all of the guns of his society work, and with the right
materials and some experimentation there is hope that he can
re-create them
-Motivations for traveling:
	-Find and kill the mercenary leader who led the destruction of his
	home, and recover the weaponry they stole
	-Discover how to create more advanced weaponry
